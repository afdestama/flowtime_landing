    </div>
    Divide your recent work session by 3 (or your chosen fraction) to determine the break duration.
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-start text-base">
    <div class="w-5 mr-2 pt-1">
      <span class="w-5 h-5 mr-2 rounded-full bg-[#FF4F17] text-white flex items-center justify-center text-xs">3</span>

    Take a break until the notification sounds or until you choose to return to work.
  </li>
  <li class="flex items-center text-base">
    <span class="w-5 h-5 mr-2 rounded-full bg-[#FF4F17] text-white flex items-center justify-center text-xs">4</span>
    Return to step 1.
  </li>
</ul>
