        <p>Flowtime is based on the innovative <a href="https://optima.blog/productivity/third-time-a-better-way-to-work/">Third Time technique</a>, offering a flexible and natural approach to managing your work and focus. Here’s how it works:</p>

<h3 id="the-core-principle">The Core Principle</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Work for as long as you feel comfortable or until you need a break.</li>
  <li>Take a break that’s one-third the duration of your work session.</li>
  <li>Repeat the cycle throughout your day.</li>
</ol>

<p>This adaptive method allows you to work in harmony with your natural rhythm, energy levels, and schedule.</p>

<h3 id="key-features-of-flowtime">Key Features of Flowtime</h3>

<h4 id="flexible-work-sessions">Flexible Work Sessions</h4>

<p>Unlike rigid time management systems, Flowtime adapts to your needs. Work for as long or as short as you like, whether it’s 15 minutes or 2 hours. The app tracks your work time automatically.</p>

<h4 id="smart-break-management">Smart Break Management</h4>

<p>Flowtime automatically calculates break durations based on your work session length (e.g., a 15-minute break after 45 minutes of work). If you take a break early, the unused time is banked and added to your next break, ensuring you always get the rest you’ve earned.</p>

<h4 id="distraction-blocking">Distraction Blocking</h4>

<p>With a simple long press, you can block potentially disruptive apps during your work sessions. Access is automatically restored during breaks or when your session ends.</p>

<h4 id="3-minute-rule">3-Minute Rule</h4>

<p>To combat procrastination, Flowtime encourages you to start tasks that take three minutes or less immediately. This simple strategy helps build momentum and reduce stress.</p>

<h4 id="progress-tracking">Progress Tracking</h4>

<p>Gain insights into your productivity patterns with Flowtime’s straightforward progress tracking. Understand your peak focus hours without getting overwhelmed by complex charts.</p>

<h3 id="using-flowtime">Using Flowtime</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Start a work session when you’re ready to focus.</li>
  <li>Work until you feel the need for a break or complete your task.</li>
  <li>Take the break suggested by the app, or bank some time for later if needed.</li>
  <li>Repeat the cycle, adjusting as necessary to your energy and schedule.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-flowtime-works">Why Flowtime Works</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Flexibility: Adapt to your natural work rhythm and changing tasks.</li>
  <li>Reduced stress: No pressure to stick to predetermined time blocks.</li>
  <li>Improved focus: Block distractions and work with your natural attention span.</li>
  <li>Better work-life balance: Track your patterns to ensure you’re not overworking.</li>
</ul>
